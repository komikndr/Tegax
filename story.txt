------------------------

So premise of the story is that. Big boss in the ocean tried sacrifice one of his child, but failed, because the child
isnt actually his, instead it is just from his wife previous marriage. They trick him when he is playing using vr
as a blind fold, because the term of the occult must be (see page down below)

The coming ritual (occult)
1. Must biological first born son
2. Must be happy while in ritual
3. Any age is fine, but implicitly younger is better since easily manipulateed
4. Need, His cloth, favourite toys.
5. Basic pentagram thing a magic
6. Tiny drop of the parrent's blood
7. Must be performed on specified geographic location

Since it is not the true son, operation goes haywire, son infected the local area network, devil partially also infected
lan, everyone is hypnotic to bring more human to feed, becasue of course, everyone is lured with high paygrade mask because
it is oil tech in middle of the ocean.

1. True antagonist: NULL?
2. Second in command : Father, Son

our protagonist is lured, since he is NEET, but has programming skill (this is me btw), task to do basic day database
maintenance, our Son decided to feel "joy ful to us", before the NULL? wants to keep us.
